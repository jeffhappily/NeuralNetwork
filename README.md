# NeuralNetwork
A simple backpropagation implementation following online courses from Siraj. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p69khggr1Jo&amp;index=3&amp;list=PL2-dafEMk2A7YdKv4XfKpfbTH5z6rEEj3

This is my first project while learning deep learning from Siraj's youtube courses. Based on Siraj, it's a simple single layer feedforward neural network, AKA perceptron. It will take binary digits as it input and output. This implementation is called backpropagation, and we are using gradient descent to train our network to train our network to make the prediction as accurate as possible.
